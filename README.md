# Getting the environment up and running

We highly recommend using a distribution of Linux when working with the website. This way installation is (somewhat) easy and all the gem versions match the overall development environment of the website. If you have a computer running windows it's either recommended to dual boot or run Linux on a virtual machine like VirtualBox.

**These instructions assume you're running Linux and that you have Git installed.**

## Installing the prerequisites

The environment requires **Ruby 2.3.0**, a recent version of **Postgres** and **Redis**.

### Installning Ruby
When installing Ruby it's easiest to first install **rbenv**:
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL
```
and then install Ruby:
```
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

rbenv install 2.3.0
rbenv global 2.3.0
```
If these commands fail you might have to install some dependencies. You can find dependencies for your distro [here](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/wiki).

### Installing Postgres
To install Postgres run these commands:
 ```
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ xenial-pgdg main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list"
wget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-common
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.5 libpq-dev
```
To use Postgres with Rails you need to create a user:
```
sudo -u postgres createuser <username> -s

# Set a password for your user which you will configure Rails with:
sudo -u postgres psql
postgres=# \password <username>

# Exiting out of Postgres terminal:
postgres=# \q
```

### Installing Redis
Redis can usually be installed with your distributionÂ´s package manager. It's often called either *redis-server* or just *redis*. On Ubuntu just run this command:
```
apt-get install redis-server
```

## Installing this environment
To install the environment you should first clone the repo. Head to your preferred directory and clone. Afterwards you need to install Rails and all the gems required. All these things can be achieved by running the following commands:
```
cd <preferred folder>
git clone https://github.com/fsek/web.git
cd web
bundle install
```
To run Rails and store data you need to configure the database connection. In the environment root folder there is a file called *.env-sample*. Copy this file and rename it to *.env*. Now enter the username and password you chose when creating a Postgres user. Enter the same username and password for both the test and dev environment. When running the commands to create the database and populate it Rails will generate a key named *SECRET_KEY_BASE*. Copy this key and paste it under *RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY* in *.env* with the following formatting:
```
SECRET_KEY_BASE=<generated key>
```
Run this command to configure the database:
```
rails db:create && rails db:seed && rails db:migrate && rails db:populate_test
```
## Running the server
To run the server and all the required services simply run the command:
```
foreman s
```

---------------------

__[stage.fsektionen.se](http://stage.fsektionen.se)__
- Follows the `stage`-branch and running on a separate database
- Is okay to merge and force push and to use as a crash course.


__[fsektionen.se](https://fsektionen.se)__
- Follows the `master`-branch and running on the production database

__What you should never do:__
- Change files directly on the server (especially running commands as root!)
- Force-push to master
- Create commits directly on master

I want my own branch!
----------------------

Call the branch something with your `ownname-feature` or `ownname/feature`.

This shows that this is your branch, you can do whatever force-pushes and equal.

If you want to integrate many features at ones, make pull-requests to a separate
branch which you can then merge into master.

I want some fresh data for my database!
-----------------------------------------------------

For a smaller setup you can use the rake-task:
`rake db:populate_test`.

If you are adding new features which should be in this database you edit the
file in `lib/tasks`.

----------------------

If you want a complete set you can dump the production database from the server
and use it locally.

On the server:

`mysqldump db/fsek_production -u root -p > mydatabase.sql`

Locally:

`scp fsektionen.se:mydatabase.sql .`

`mysql fsek_development -u root -p < mindatabas.sql`

rake db:migrate


Layout things:
======================
For compiling our stylesheets and javascript files there are two main files.

For **CSS** there is `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss` where the needed
CSS is added with `@import`-tags.

All css located in the `stylesheets/style` folder holds our theme laying over
our Bootstrap.

All css located in the `stylesheets/partials` is our own written scss files,
split on controller or function.

All files in these folders will be loaded.

For **Javascript** we have the same setup but using Sprockets.
This is seen in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`.

All the local files go into these folders.


Files from Vendors, such ass from plugins or gems are placed in `vendor/assets`.

Files that are not from vendors but not project specific goes into `lib/assets`.

Images which are used in layouts and similar should be placed in:
`app/assets/images`.

An image in this folder called `image.jpg` can be referenced with:

`<%= image_tag('image.jpg') %>`

If you are looking for **icons**:
- visit [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) and
  find your icon
- Use the helper method to call it: `fa_icon('user')`.


Creating new controllers
=====================

For example `news_controller`:

To use our authentication system Cancancan you need to call:
`load_permissions_and_authorize_resource`

before all your controller methods.

It will load and evaluate all user permissions, but also prepare your standard
actions by loading the resources.

If the command is called in the beginning, your `show`-action can be change
from:
```
def show
  @news = News.find(params[:id])
end
```

to:

```
def show
end
```

With the same results!

The same goes for `:edit, :new, :index, :create, :update, :destroy`.

All you need to add for standard functionality is in the end, under the
`private` scope:
```
private

def news_params
  params.require(:news).permit(:title,..
end
```

---------------------

Happy coding!
