       Welcome to the F-guild and Lund!

        Here you will find all the information you need to prepare for the start of your studies and the introduction:
        <ul>
        <li>Everything you need to know about %{en_introduction}.</li>
        <li> %{en_checklist} for the start of your studies.</li>
        </ul>

        One of your mentors will call you later in August to try to answer any questions you might have about the introduction or starting university.

        The FREJA association is organizing a meeting for girls and non-binaries on the 25th of August (the day before the introduction). More information can be found on their <a href="https://www.frejalth.se/">website</a>.

        The start of this year's introduction: An introduction among bandits, is on the 26th of August. The introduction will then run for five weeks until Saturday, September 28.

        We who organize the introduction are called %{foset}. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us! You can reach us either via %{en_contact} or %{anonymous_contact} if you want to be anonymous.

        We look forward to welcoming you to the F-guild and LTH!
