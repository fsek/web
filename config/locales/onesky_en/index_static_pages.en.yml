      first_paragraph: "The F-guild at TLTH is a non-profit student association for students at the engineering programs Engineering physics, Engineering mathematics or Engineering nanoscience and its purpose is to promote fellowship among members and look after their common interests."
      second_paragraph: "The guild has its spaces in the Math building where you can find common rooms, microwave-ovens, and the guild’s own Hilbert Café - where you can buy coffee and great baguettes. The F-guild have several councils in charge of different parts of the activities of the guild. Each council is headed by a chairman who is also a part of the guild’s council of executives. The guild also have a board that’s in charge of the central function of the guild."
      third_paragraph: "As a member of the guild you can choose to be active and committed or to just take part at some events. If you have any questions you can always get in touch with someone from the board or the council of executives, via the Contact tab on the website or in the Board room in the far south of the Hilbert corridor (behind Hilbert Café)! We hope that you will enjoy your time at the F-guild."
